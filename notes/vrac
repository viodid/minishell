x Add basic envp in case of (!envp)
x Add SHLVL handling
- Fix exit behaviour on exit
	- Fix double free on core->line->fds when exiting via builtin
	- Fix leak in case of exit (started in exec_builtin)
- Fix cd behaviour according to BASH in cd a/a/ && rm -rf ../../a
	- OLDPWD should be concatenated with cd . and cd .. values 
	- cd should throw an error if directory not found in these cases
- Delete heredoc files after usage
	- Replace HDOC redir by HDOC_FILE redir and iterate them for unlinking at the end
- Functions to refactor
	- do_heredocs()
	- ft_exit()
	x ft_cd()
	- exec_selector()



----------------------


is it possible to make a single function for exec a command?

regardless of different contexts :
- if builtin
- if pipes or not
- different positions in the line
- if && or || operators


that would imply making a selector function to send arguments to :
- execve
- exec_builtin

arguments would be :
- fdin
- fdout
- char *pathname
- char **args
- char **envp

this function would return an errcode which would correspond to exit status ?


>> PIPES (scratched)
alternate pipes with pipe[0] = pipe[1]

ls | sleep 1 | pwd | echo hola

ls > pipe[0][1]
