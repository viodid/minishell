- Add basic envp in case of (!envp)
- Add SHLVL handling



----------------------


is it possible to make a single function for exec a command?

regardless of different contexts :
- if builtin
- if pipes or not
- different positions in the line
- if && or || operators


that would imply making a selector function to send arguments to :
- execve
- exec_builtin

arguments would be :
- fdin
- fdout
- char *pathname
- char **args
- char **envp

this function would return an errcode which would correspond to exit status ?


>> PIPES (scratched)
alternate pipes with pipe[0] = pipe[1]

ls | sleep 1 | pwd | echo hola

ls > pipe[0][1]
